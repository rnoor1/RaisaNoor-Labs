# Godot 2D Forest Project

This project has a main scene with two different sprites (tree and rock).  
I created a separate tree scene and instanced it multiple times to make a forest.  
Through this, I learned how to use nested scenes in Godot and how to push a project to GitHub.  
To run it, open the project in Godot and play `Main.tscn`.
